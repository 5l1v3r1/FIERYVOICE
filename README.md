# FIERYVOICE
A random idea to provide a laugh, and the occasional gem. 

This is a simple script to generate a random name to be used for anything. It simply
concatenates a randomly chosen adjective, and noun from a list, and prints the result. 

Use the -n arguement to print x number of codenames.
